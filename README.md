# Home-Warning-Security-System-for-Blind-people-using-Face-Detection-
Home Security and Warning System using Face Recognition Abstract In this project we integrate HomeSecurity With Facial Recognition system.A face recognition system is one of the biometric information processes, its applicability is easier and working range is larger than others, i.e.; fingerprint, iris scanning, signature, etc. A face recognition system is designed, to identify the persons around you. The system uses a combination of techniques in two topics; face detection and recognition. The face detection is performed on live acquired images without any application field in mind. Processes utilized in the system are white balance corrections, skin like region segmentation, facial feature extraction and face image extraction on a face candidate. Then a face classification method that uses haarcascade is integrated in the system. The system is tested with a database generated in the with 30 people. The tested system has acceptable performance to recognize faces within intended limits and gives the feedback to raspberry pi for further actions to be performed based on input. The system basically acts like a surveillance body for a house keeping an eye on buglers and unusual activity at the house.
